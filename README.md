# End-To-End Learning for Stock Price Prediction
> COMS 4995 Deep Learning Project (team 8), 2019 Fall

Stock price prediction is important in financial companies, because precise predictions can help traders design better trading strategies. In this work, we propose to use heterogeneous data, i.e. historical stock price and events information to predict future price. We design an end-to-end deep learning framework based on LSTM to learn feature representations for these two types of data and predict future prices. Experimental results show that our full model outperforms two base- line models and the abladed versions of our own, which proves the capacity and effectiveness of our model. In CUDL competition, we applied our model to predict future price and achieved 2nd place with total loss = 0.68, much better than the given baseline.
